# Number of ways to make change
#Given an array of distinct positive integers representing coin denominations and a single non negative integer n representing a target amount of money. Write a function that returns the number of ways to make change for that target amount using the given coin denominations.
# Note that an unlimited amount of coins is at your disposal

# n = 6
# denom = [1, 5]

#Sample output
# 2 // 1x1 + 1x5 and 6x1
